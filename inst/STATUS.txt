Version 0.53-4, 4/28/2009:

   Changed the license to GPL-3.


Version 0.53-3, 4/28/2009:

   Commented out an empty example in a help file.


Version 0.53-2, 10/16/2008:

   Fixed a bug in fitGamma.


Version 0.53-1, 8/25/2008:

   Added a function est.recrate for obtaining a smoothed estimate of
   the recombination rate along a chromosome, using the cM and Mbp
   position of markers.


Version 0.52-8, 8/21/2008:

   Fixed a slight error in the help file for fitGamma.


Version 0.52-7, 10/9/2007:

   Fixed some slight problems in the help files.


Version 0.52-6, 9/20/2007:

    Changed my email address, etc., due to my move to UW-Madison


Version 0.52-5, 4/26/2007:

    Added a function joint.given.two for calculating the joint density
    of the crossover locations, given that there are two.

    Added a function est.coi, for estimating the three-point
    coincidence along a chromosome.


Version 0.51-3, 12/20/2006:

    Added function est.intensity and est.kfunc to estimate the
    intensity and K_inhom functions for an inhomogeneous point
    process.

    Revised most of the functions for calculating densities and
    such so that you may specify (via the argument "x") the
    exact values at which these functions are to be calculated.
    If x is unspecified, we calculate things at n equally spaced
    points between 0 and L.


Version 0.50-18, 12/18/2006:

    A newly created package.
